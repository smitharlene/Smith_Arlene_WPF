//If the Texans wins are greater than 7 games or score 30 points a game, they keep their current coach.  If not, they will get a new coach.

var gamePoints = 15;

(texansWins > 7 || gamePoints >= 30)? console.log("The Texans can keep their current coach!"): console.log("The Texans will need to get a new coach!");
