//We are picking up family members from the airport.  I can fit 4 passengers in my SUV,
// if the amount of passengers is more than that I will need to rent a car.
//Can I pick them up in my car or do I have to rent a bigger car?

var familyMembers = 5 ;
var suvPassengersCapacity = 4;

//family members will have to equal or be less than my passenger capacity.  If it's less, I can pick them up in my car.  If it's more I need to rent a car.

(familyMembers <= suvPassengersCapacity) ? console.log("You can pick up the family in the SUV.") : console.log("You will need to rent a bigger car.");
